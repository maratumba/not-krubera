      <h2>No, That Is Not Krubera Cave</h2>  
      <p>
        You are here probably because you saw this picture on the internet and thought it was the Krubera Cave.
        In fact, it's a picture of the Fantastic Pit from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellison%27s_Cave">Ellison's Cave</a>, 
        which is in Georgia, US.

         The pit (or the drop) is 179 meters (586 feet) deep and is the deepest pitch in continental US. 
         Ellison's Cave is the 12th deepest cave in the US with a total depth of 324 meters (1063 feet).

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krubera_Cave">Krubera - Voronya Cave</a> is in Georgia and is the 
        second deepest cave with 2199 meters (7215 feet) depth. The deepest cave in the world is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veryovkina_Cave">
          Veryovkina Cave</a> at 2223 meters (7293 feet).
      </p>
      <p>Cave entrances of most of the caves are high up in the mountains so even the deepest point is not below sea level.</p>
