          The Fantastic Pit is 179 meters (586 feet) deep and is the deepest
          pitch in continental US. Ellison's Cave is the 12th deepest cave in
          the US with a total depth of 324 meters (1063 feet).
        </p>
        <p>
          The pit in Mystery Falls is 85 meters (281 feet) deep and is the
          deepest pit in Tennessee US.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/30/china">Miao Keng Cave</a> in China 
          has the deepest pit in the world with 491 meters (1611 feet). The pit starts 150 meters (492 feet) 
          below the surface.
        </p>
        <h2>What does "depth of a cave" even mean?</h2>
        <p>
          Depth of a cave is the difference between the highest point of the
          cave and the lowest point of the cave. Most caves descend into the
          depths of the earth in several steps or pits, which are usually less
          than 50 meters (164 feet). So even though Krubera Cave is the deepest cave in the
          world, it is not a single pit that is 2199 meters deep. It is a series
          of pits that add up to 2199 meters.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can read about the expedition to the Krubera Cave when it was the
          deepest cave in the world:

        <h2>Also, they are not the closest points to earth's center</h2>
        <p>
          Cave entrances of most of the caves are high up in the mountains so
          even the deepest point is not even below sea level. So they are not
          "the closest point to the center of the earth" by a long shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closest point to the center of the earth depends on what you exactly
          mean (dry? reachable by humans?).

          of all the different things it could mean and their depths.
