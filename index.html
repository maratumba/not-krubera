      <h2>No, That Is Not The Krubera - Voronya Cave</h2>  
      <p>
        You are here because you saw a picture similar to what's below on the internet along with a claim that it is the Krubera Cave,
         the deepest cave in the world. Both of these claims are wrong. The picture is of the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fantastic-pit">Fantastic Pit</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellison%27s_Cave">Ellison's Cave</a>, 
        which is in Georgia, US and Krubera cave is not the deepest cave anymore.

         The pit (or the drop) is 179 meters (586 feet) deep and is the deepest pitch in continental US. 
         Ellison's Cave is the 12th deepest cave in the US with a total depth of 324 meters (1063 feet).

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krubera_Cave">Krubera - Voronya Cave</a> is in Georgia and is the 
        second deepest cave with 2199 meters (7215 feet) depth. The deepest cave in the world is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veryovkina_Cave">
          Veryovkina Cave</a> at 2223 meters (7293 feet). Here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deepest_caves">a list of deepest caves in the world</a>.

      <h2>Also They Are Not The Closest Points To Earth's Center</h2>
      <p>Cave entrances of most of the caves are high up in the mountains 
        so even the deepest point is not even below sea level. So they are not "the closest point 
        to the center of the earth" by a long shot. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Closest point to the center of the earth depends on what you exactly mean (dry? reachable by humans?). 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremes_on_Earth#Lowest_points">Here's a comprehensive list</a> of 
        all the different things it could mean and their depths.
